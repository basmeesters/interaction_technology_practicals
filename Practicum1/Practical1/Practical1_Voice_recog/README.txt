Manual:
	When the program is started it is possible to control the mouse	with your voice. 
	It responds to left, right, top and bottom for their respective	directions  and
	wil stop moving again when stop, halt or hold is spoken. Their are some default
	settins which can be changed, which are the volume of the speaker, the speed rate 
	of the speaker and the speed of the mouse movement. Their is also a switch to change
	the mouse movement from voice recognition to pure speech recognition. When one of the
	four directions is spoken the hearbox will show what it heard and the certainty rate.
	When the speak button is pressed it will speak the text in textbox.
	
Known issues:
- Top and stop are not always recognized right, bottom also is hard to recognize.
  Both are though problems from the speech recognition library.
- The switch between speech recognition from mouse movement to speech recognition to text 
  does not work properly.
- It is at this moment for unknown reasons only possible to do one command and let it stop.
  it will not allow you to speak a direction again.
